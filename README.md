# System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was designed to be an application that allowed users to access driving tests, courses and catalogues to help them pass their drivers learning course that allowed instructors to access users information, know what packages they ordered and be able to provide each user with relative information for the courses and tests. The client was Liam who owns DriverPass and had a vision for the program to assist users with driving tests and courses. They wanted a system that allowed users to take online driving tests and courses anyhwere at any time that also provides on the road training.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt I was able to visualize the system better than anything else and show what the makings the system would be.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would try to change my explanations of how each part of the system was and how it worked, I would try to break down other systems to see how those worked to have a better understanding of how to break down systems and tell how each part worked.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I tried to look outside as someone who knows nothing about programming and visualize a website that does everything the client wants, imagining other sites that worked similar to what they want that I have already used in the past such as SNHU's education portal. The user's needs are the most important part of the program because they are the customer who will use the program, you want a program that is easy to use and makes the user satisifed using it and have them want to come back and use it again instead of looking for alternatives.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach it as someone who has expectations and wants to to see it realized on a computer screen and be able to make it user friendly for everyone, when analyzing future systems, I will always try to see how each system tries to satisfy its user and try to incorporate that into my own work.
